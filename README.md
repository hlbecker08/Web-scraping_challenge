# Web-scraping_challenge

The code for this challenge can be found in the folder 'Starter_Code'. 'part_1_mars_new.ipynb' scraps the website for titles and previews. 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb' scraps a website table and does an analysis on Mars weather. The data frame created in part two is outputed as csv file into the 'Data' folder.

I worked with Conner Dekok some on this assignment.
